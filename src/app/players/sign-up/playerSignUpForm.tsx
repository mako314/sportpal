    // Part 2 - Academics
    // GPA
    // ACT / SAT
    // Current School Year
    // Graduation date, 
    // College Major?
    // Middle - College ? 

    // Part 3 - Sports
    // Should include club team option, school team, travel team, academy team?
    // In this part, one may get away with having them write positions and such, but maybe it's better to have our own on hand? 
    // Sport
    // Player position
    // Secondary Position
    // Coaches 
    

    // Option to include their accolades

    // Need to have state object to be sent in, with types declared
    // Will include all of the above.

    // Way to authenticate user will be done after / authenticate / cache/ cookies?
